                <p>
                    I am a full stack web developer, with 5+ years of experience,
                    currently looking for a backend oriented position.
                    The technology stack I used in the last 2 years: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, REST API, Apollo
                    GraphQL, Golang, Docker, AWS,
                    React, Redux, Vue, Ionic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a test oriented developer: I design and write test, whenever feasible, before write the code.
                    My testing approach is top-down (user perspective) where I started from E2E or integration testing
                    then water down to unit tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am experienced in working in an agile team, using colaboration method and tools like Scrum, Jira,
                    Github, etc.
                </p>

                <p>I quitted working in 2017 due to eye problem. Since 2020 I learned to use screen reader, so I can
                    code without seeing the screen. Currently ~95% of time I code with screen reader (Demos are listed
                    in link).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the past projects I had used various technologies such as: PHP
                    frameworks, MySQL, JQuery, and Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have knowledge and practical skill (screen reader user) to develop an
                    accessible web application. I completed a short online course titled
                    "Introduction to Web Accessibility" in Dec 2020 - Jan 2021.</p>
